# mnist-neural-net
This is a practice repository solely made for having fun with PDB, GitBash and Docker. 

The documentations of the process that took place when implementing each of these is located here:
1. PDB
2. GitBash
3. Docker


## PDB





## GitBash

### Initialization 
A git repository was supposed to be initialized at our local setup. The git repo initially had all related files untracked. We used linux commands to add the files to our repo

### Branch Creation
After working on our code in the master branch we came at an empasse and were forced to tune the hyperparameteres of our model as it was overfitting. We made a new branch called 'bugfix'

### Merging Branches
After fixing the issue we merged the 'bugfix' branch back to our main branch.

### Pushing to Hub
When satisfied with our current code and setup we pushed our code from our local repository to GitHub.
